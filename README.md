# 🚚 Quantum-Inspired Fleet Optimization

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on solving the *Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)* — a core challenge in logistics and supply chain management. Classical solutions struggle to scale beyond 30–50 delivery nodes due to exponential complexity.

We leverage *quantum-inspired algorithms* and *classical simulations of quantum systems* to achieve scalable, efficient, and real-world ready route optimization — *without needing quantum hardware*.

## 🛑 Problem Statement

* Logistics companies face huge inefficiencies in *path planning and route optimization*.
* Classical VRP solvers have *exponential complexity (O(n!))*, making large-scale (100+ locations) optimization infeasible.
* Current AI/ML solutions are slow or too costly for real-time decisions.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

We use a *hybrid quantum-inspired approach* combining:

1. *Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA)* → explores large solution spaces using Monte Carlo methods to avoid local minima.
2. *Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithms (QIEA)* → evolves smarter solutions while respecting constraints (capacity, time windows).
3. *Classical QAOA Simulation (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm)* → simulated via neural networks, enabling 54-qubit scale experiments on classical GPUs.

This combination provides *scalable, near-optimal routes* for fleets in real time.

Pink, do you want me to also make a *short one-paragraph abstract version of this README* (like a 60–70 word summary) that you can paste into hackathon submissions or intro slides?
